These are spreadsheets I use when doing performance tests on diagnostic imaging equipment.
The spreadsheets are based on similar spreadsheets I used during my medical physics residency at Henry Ford Hospital.

The spreadsheets follow the same general structure.

* Equipment information
* Regulatory compliance items
* Test data
* Comments

The spreadsheets are divided into two halves. The left half is used for data collection while the right half is the printed report.
