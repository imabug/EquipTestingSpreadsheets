Equipment Testing Spreadsheets
==============================

These are spreadsheets I use when doing performance tests on diagnostic imaging equipment.
The spreadsheets are based on similar spreadsheets I used during my medical physics residency at Henry Ford Hospital.

The spreadsheets follow the same general structure.

* Equipment information
* Regulatory compliance items
* Test data
* Comments

The spreadsheets are divided into two halves. The left half is used for data collection while the right half is the printed report.

Radiographic
------------
MUSCGenForm.xlsx is used for testing radiographic and portable units. It is largely unmodified (aside from changing radiation exposure units) from the version originally developed by Phil Rauch at Henry Ford Hospital.

Fluoroscopy
-----------
MUSCCArm.ods is used for testing fluoroscopy units (portable c-arms, fixed fluoroscopy, interventional, cath lab).

Mammography
-----------
Due to significant differences between various FFDM mammography manufacturers, separate spreadsheets have been developed for each vendor (Hologic, Siemens). The Philips spreadsheet (MUSCMammoPhilips.xlsx) is based on spreadsheets used for the Sectra LD50 scanning mammo unit.

The mammography spreadsheets have the same basic structure, although each is tweaked slightly to reflect differences in QA/QC tests required by each manufacturer.

MUSCMammoStereotactic.ods is used for stereotactic breast biopsy units

MUSCMammoHologic.ods is used for Hologic Selenia systems with Mo and W targets, and can also be used for Hologic systems with the tomosynthesis option (Selenia Dimensions).

MUSCMammoSiemens.xlsm is used for Siemens Inspiration mammography units. Major differences include additional sections for W/Rh output measurement and a different method for calculating AGD.

Mammography workstation monitors
--------------------------------
MUSCMammoMonitor.ods is used to for testing of mammography workstation monitors. The spreadsheet is designed around the procedures for Agfa Impax workstations.

Currently still in beta status.

CT
--
Used for CT scanners. CTDI section is designed to make use of the RTI Electronics CT16 slice probe.

MUSCBoneDensity.ods
-------------------
Used for scatter radiation measurements of bone density units.

Dental CT
---------
MUSCDentalCT.ods is used for testing cone beam dental CT units.

Currently in alpha status

Shielding design
----------------
MUSCShield_form.xlsx is used for performing shielding calculations and post-installation shielding evaluations.

NRCP147Tables.ods is a collection of tables from NCRP 147 used for shielding calculations and tables from other shielding related papers. These tables will be eventually folded into the new shielding design spreadsheet under development.

Currently under redevelopment.

Survey summary sheet
------------------
MUSCSurveySummary.ott is a LibreOffice template used to list the recommendations from a survey.
